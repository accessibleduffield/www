			<h1 class="mb-5 text-3xl font-bold">Welcome everyone</h1>

			<p class="mb-5">Duffield is a beautiful village and a great place to live. Accessible Duffield is a small local charity that aims to make life easier for disabled people and their family and friends.</p>

			<p class="mb-5">Whether you want to stroll around the village or visit the shops or cafes or pubs, we can tell you what’s there. Is the place really wheelchair accessible? Is there a usable toilet? How many steps are there? Do they have large print menus, or hearing loops?</p>

			<p class="mb-5">It won’t be perfect. Things change. But we will be doing our best to keep the information up to date. We will need your help to tell us what you find and what else you need.</p>

			<p class="mb-5">Our plan is to work with the businesses and premises in Duffield to establish what barriers there might be for people with disabilities and what might be done to remove them if possible.  We began discussions in 2020 and then Covid-19 put a halt to the plans.</p>

			<p class="mb-5">During the pandemic we have been able to carry out access audits on the public footpaths in the village. We have examined the paths, jitties, ginnels, alleys for accessibility and we are now able to publish the information. We have not yet assessed the roadside pavements nor the public rights of way across the fields outside the built-up areas.</p>

			<p class="mb-5">We hope that you find the information useful. Do, please, tell us of any errors or anything else that is important to you.</p>

			<p class="mb-5">Once the 50 or so village businesses get back to normal, we will get back to working with them on access audits of their premises so that we can all continue to enjoy living here in Duffield.</p>

			<h2 class="mb-5 font-semibold">Thanks to</h2>
