	<p>Accessible Duffield is a new small local charity. Our aims are to raise awareness of disability, supply advice and training, and access to disability audits & guides in and around this lovely village.</p>

	<p>Our web site will need continual updating as things change. Please let us have any comments and suggestions.</p>

	<p>Our small group are all Duffield residents with interests and experience in disabling conditions in adults and children. Our wider group includes other volunteers who are able to contribute to achieving our aims of raising awareness and improving village life for everyone.</p>
