	<p>Buses are frequent in Town Street travelling along the A6.</p>

	<p>Trent Barton buses on the sixes and across the network are wheelchair-friendly.  The team will always do everything reasonably practicable to carry all customers. This includes encouraging, where possible, those occupying areas designed to assist wheelchair users, to vacate them.</p>

	<p>Wheelchair or scooter - if it fits, it’s allowed on. Only one wheelchair user the bus at any one time and they must be positioned with the back against the specially designed upright cushion in order to travel safely.</p>

	<p>A vast majority of buses are fitted with audio and visual announcements helping to ensure people with sight loss can confidently and competently travel self-reliantly.</p>
