	<h2>Volunteer Policy</h2>

	<p>Accessible Duffield is run entirely by volunteers. Key members of the group either have extensive training and experience in the disability field or personal experience of a disability.</p>

	<p>Accessible Duffield is committed to Safeguarding and to ensuring the welfare of children, young people and vulnerable adults and expects all volunteers to share this commitment.</p>

	<p>Volunteers are expected to promote equal opportunities and will be supported to take an active stance where necessary against all forms of harassment or discriminatory behaviour.</p>

	<p>Accessible Duffield welcomes volunteers who are able to bring commitment to the role. Accessible Duffield will provide training as appropriate and relevant to their development.</p>

	<p>All volunteers will have their personal details protected under the GDPR.</p>

	<h2>Code of Practice</h2>

	<p>Accessible Duffield aims to raise disability awareness; supply training to staff and volunteers; to supply advice and access to disability audits and guides in Duffield.</p>

	<p>
		All volunteers have either: <br>
		Training in equal opportunities and disability or experience of living with a disability or have received relevant training from other members of Accessible Duffield.
	</p>

	<p>As a voluntary organisation we aim to keep up to date with appropriate training and to be aware of any new developments in the field.</p>

	<p>All advice provided is on an advisory basis only e.g., disability audits.</p>

	<p>Footpaths will continue to be monitored on a yearly basis to ensure maximum safety.	Footpaths within the wider environment will be audited for suitability working in conjunction with others e.g. Walking for Health.</p>

	<p>Accessible Duffield is committed to working with other organisations within Duffield to promote equal opportunities and disability awareness e.g. Good Neighbours, Parish Council and the DCA.</p>

	<h2>Equality and Diversity Policy</h2>

	<p class="font-bold">1. Purpose and Scope </p>

	<p>Accessible Duffield recognises that everyone has a contribution to make to our society and the right to equality of opportunity.  We recognise that people can experience discrimination or lack of opportunity for reasons which are not fair and are committed to providing a fair and just service to advocate the needs of people who are disadvantaged or under-represented in our community.</p>

	<p>Accessible Duffield aims to achieve equality of opportunity in its activities and services.</p>

	<p>We recognise that discrimination and associated disadvantages affect a wide range of groups and individuals in our society including:</p>

	<ul class="mb-5 list-disc list-inside">
		<li>Race (including), colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, refugees, asylum seekers, Gypsies and Travellers</li>
		<li>Gender including gender identity or reassignment,</li>
		<li>Marital or civil partnership status</li>
		<li>Caring responsibility</li>

	</ul>

	<p>Accessible Duffield is strongly opposed to any form of discrimination and seeks to ensure that its own policies and practices are non-discriminatory. Our aim is to create a culture that respects and values each otherâ€™s differences, provide a working environment that offers dignity at work and is free from discrimination, prejudice and harassment.</p>

	<p>In addition, Accessible Duffield recognises the need for positive action to challenge and counteract the effects of discrimination in our own policy and practice.</p>

	<p>This policy reflects our legal responsibility in relation to the recruitment and selection of staff, their terms and conditions of employment; including pay, promotion, training, transfer and every other aspect of employment.</p>

	<p>Additionally, this policy reflects our expectation that all volunteers will be treated equally in relation to their recruitment, selection and training in volunteering opportunities and that Accessible Duffield will take an active stance against all forms of harassment and discrimination.</p>

	<p>All individuals and organisations using our services will be informed of our equal opportunities statement and its operation within those services will be subject to review.</p>

	<p class="font-bold">2. Procedure and Responsibilities</p>

	<p class="font-bold">Information & Publicity</p>

	<p>All staff and volunteers will be expected to follow the procedures outlined within this policy and related policies.</p>

	<p>Every effort will be made by Accessible Duffield to ensure that circulated information and publicity reaches all members of our community.  Additional attention will be given to source locations which may target underrepresented groups and individuals.</p>

	<p>All our publicity, information and training literature will include positive images of all people, especially those disadvantaged by society.  We will take special care that this literature is free from language, attitudes and images which are sexist, racist, ageist, disabling or negative towards sexuality or gender.</p>

	<p>Every effort will be made to obtain information relevant to under represented groups and disadvantaged individuals.  Where signposting to other sources provides a better service, the information needed will be available and up to date.</p>
