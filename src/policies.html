	<h2>Volunteer policy</h2>

	<p>Accessible Duffield is run entirely by volunteers. Key members of the group either have extensive training and experience in the disability field or personal experience of a disability.</p>

	<p>Accessible Duffield is committed to Safeguarding and to ensuring the welfare of children, young people and vulnerable adults and expects all volunteers to share this commitment.</p>

	<p>Volunteers are expected to promote equal opportunities and will be supported to take an active stance where necessary against all forms of harassment or discriminatory behaviour.</p>

	<p>Accessible Duffield welcomes volunteers who are able to bring commitment to the role. Accessible Duffield will provide training as appropriate and relevant to their development.</p>

	<p>All volunteers will have their personal details protected under the GDPR.</p>

	<h2>Code of Practice</h2>

	<p>Accessible Duffield aims to raise disability awareness; supply training to staff and volunteers; to supply advice and access to disability audits and guides in Duffield.</p>

	<p>
		All volunteers have either: <br>
		Training in equal opportunities and disability or experience of living with a disability or have received relevant training from other members of Accessible Duffield.
	</p>

	<p>As a voluntary organisation we aim to keep up to date with appropriate training and to be aware of any new developments in the field.</p>

	<p>All advice provided is on an advisory basis only e.g., disability audits.</p>

	<p>Footpaths will continue to be monitored on a yearly basis to ensure maximum safety.	Footpaths within the wider environment will be audited for suitability working in conjunction with others e.g. Walking for Health.</p>

	<p>Accessible Duffield is committed to working with other organisations within Duffield to promote equal opportunities and disability awareness e.g. Good Neighbours, Parish Council and the DCA.</p>
